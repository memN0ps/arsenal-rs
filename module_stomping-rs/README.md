# Module Stomping / Module Overloading / DLL Hollowing

A basic/simple PoC in Rust

## Description

Module stomping injects a Microsoft-signed DLL (e.g amsi.dll) using a classic DLL Injection technique that uses as shown here: [Classic DLL Injection in Rust](https://github.com/memN0ps/arsenal-rs/tree/main/dll_injector_classic-rs). It will then read the `AddressOfEntryPoint` of the injected DLL from the target process and overwrite the content with shellcode.

In this example we use the following steps to perfrom a classic DLL Injection of `amsi.dll` inside `notepad.exe` and then inject our shellcode inside `amsi.dll's` entry point:

* `OpenProcess` - Open a handle to the target process with `PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS`
* `VirtualAllocEx` - Allocate memory for `amsi.dll` full path
* `WriteProcessMemory` - Write the DLL path to the target process memory
* `GetModuleHandleA` - Get a handle to `kernel32.dll`
* `GetProcAddress` - Get the address of `LoadLibraryA`
* `CreateRemoteThread` - Create a thread in the target process

We can now inject our shellcode into the target process

* Get the module (amsi.dll) base address from the target process (notepad.exe) that we just injected
* `ReadProcessMemory` - To read the the DOS and NT headers to get the `AddressOfEntryPoint` of `asmi.dll` in the target process (notepad.exe)
* `WriteProcessMemory` - To overwrite the `AddressOfEntryPoint` content with our shellcode
* `CreateRemoteThread`- Create a thread to run the contents of our shellcode inside `amsi.dll` that is inside `notepad.exe` in this example.

Process Monitor's Load Image event shows that `amsi.dll` was loaded.

Process Explorer shows that `amsi.dll` was loaded too and we can see that our shellcode was executed from the `MessageBoxA` pop-up, which was generated by `msfvenom -p windows/x64/messagebox -f rust`

![Process Monitor](./injection.png)

We can look at `notepad.exe` threads that are running, which shows that thread `9616` with the start address of `Amsi!AmsiUacScan+0xabe0`.

We can inspect this memory location in more detail with `Windbg`. The memory location resolves to `Amsi!DLLMainCRTStartup` and the bytes located in this memory location contains our shellcode.
