## Reflective Loader in Rust (4KB in size)

A small reflective loader PoC in Rust. I remade this from my old project (https://github.com/memN0ps/arsenal-rs/tree/main/rdi-rs), which is almost the same but has a smaller file size, thanks to this repo: https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust

## Features

More coming soon, maybe or maybe I'll modify the Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection project to work better: https://github.com/memN0ps/srdi-rs

## Example

Bring your own injector (BYOI) or the simple injector in this PoC for testing.

1. Open `notepad.exe` 

2. Build the `reflective_loader` project in release.
```
PS C:\Users\developer\Documents\GitHub\rdi-rs\reflective_loader> cargo build --release
   Compiling reflective_loader v0.1.0 (C:\Users\developer\Documents\GitHub\rdi-rs\reflective_loader)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.48s
PS C:\Users\developer\Documents\GitHub\rdi-rs\reflective_loader>
```

2. Set the Powershell environment variable for debugging and `cargo run`

```
C:\Users\developer\Documents\GitHub\rdi-rs\inject> $Env:RUST_LOG="info"

PS C:\Users\developer\Documents\GitHub\rdi-rs\inject> cargo run

```

3. You should see the following

4. File size

Note: This is just a PoC, and there is still some OPSEC to worry about. I'll leave that as an exercise for the user. I have included the references below for you to check out to weaponize this for red team engagements.
